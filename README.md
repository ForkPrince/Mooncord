## Why does Mooncord exist?

Mooncord started as a fork of Vencord called Blazecord, adding custom plugins I developed. However, after discovering <a href="https://github.com/verticalsync/Suncord">Suncord</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord">Equicord</a>, I decided to create the ultimate fork by combining both projects.

## Should I use Mooncord?

No, you shouldn't, your probably better off using [Equicord *(personal pick)*](https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord) or [Suncord](https://github.com/verticalsync/Suncord). Mooncord is pretty good, but it's primarily for personal use and I won't be maintaining it frequently unless I notice an issue.

  <summary>Using Mooncord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>
  Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

  However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine as long as you don’t use any plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

  Regardless, if your account is very important to you and it getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Mooncord), just to be safe

  Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Mooncord in a server where you might get banned for it
